NOTE:
-----

WidePix was conceived on March 15, 2020, before there was any public knowledge
about the widescreen images that shipped with the September 2020 update of the
Unity port of Doom.

The key differences between my pack and the Unity pack are:

- Completely built from the ground up (not based off the Unity graphics)
- The original 4:3 portion is left completely unaltered*
- Ultrawide (21:9) aspect ratio support
- Custom animation for Doom 1 Episode 3
- [NEW!] Now includes support for Heretic and Hexen
- Widescreen weapon sprite extensions (for Doom, Heretic and Hexen)

* I would never arbitrarily change the center image as I feel it's important
to preserve the original artwork. However, that said, there are some cases
where alterations were unavoidable because not doing so would've made it
impossible to extend the images. I have documented such cases below:

TNT INTERPIC: There was a solid-black, 1-pixel border around the image.

Hexen TITLEPIC and INTERPIC: There were what appeared to be anti-aliasing
artifacts on the left and right borders.

COMING SOON:
------------

Strife, Hacx and Chex Quest support. Stay tuned!
