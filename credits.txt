NOTE:
-----

WidePix was conceived on March 15, 2020, before there was any public knowledge
about the widescreen images that shipped with the September 2020 update of the
Unity port of Doom.

Differences between WidePix and Doom Unity:

- Completely built from the ground up (not based off Doom Unity's graphics)
- The original 4:3 portion is left completely unaltered where possible*
- Ultrawide (21:9) aspect ratio support
- Custom animation for Doom 1 Episode 3
- Weapon sprite extensions (both horizontally/vertically, where applicable)

* I generally avoid changing the center image as I feel it's important to
preserve the original artwork. However, that said, there are some cases where
alterations were unavoidable because not doing so would've made it impossible
to extend the images. I have documented such cases below:

TNT INTERPIC: There was a solid-black, 1-pixel border around the image.

Hexen TITLEPIC and INTERPIC: There were what appeared to be anti-aliasing
artifacts on the left and right borders.

Strife SS4F3, SS5F1, SS5F3, SS6F2, SS6F3, VELLOGO: Weird artifacts at the
borders made the images impossible to extend.

Chex Quest WIMAP0: There's a bright 1-pixel-wide sliver to the left.
