WidePix v1.0
-------------

Made by Nash Muhandes

(C) 2020 Nash Muhandes

A collection of widescreen (up to 21:9!) 2D graphics replacements. Throw it in
your autoload, enjoy widescreen images!

Feel free to include WidePix in your mods, or use the graphics as a base for
modification, as long as this credits file stays intact.

NOTE:
-----

WidePix was conceived on March 15, 2020... way before there was any public
knowledge about the September 2020 Doom Unity update that contained "official"
widescreen patches.

My goal was, and always will be, to make sure that the original 4:3 portion
of the image stays _completely unaltered_. This is the main difference
between WidePix and the Doom Unity widescreen images.

So if you are wondering, what's the difference between this and that...
there's my answer.

source artwork exists :^) Also for providing the unaltered Doom 1 Registered
TITLEPIC (I only have access to Ultimate Doom).

Some high resolution images were used as a source to create the widescreen
extensions. They are listed below.
