WidePix v1.0

A collection of widescreen (up to 21:9!) 2D graphics replacements.

Please see license.md for licensing info.

NOTE:
-----

WidePix was conceived on March 15, 2020, before there was any public knowledge
about the widescreen images that shipped with the September 2020 update of the
Unity port of Doom.

The key differences between my pack and the Unity pack are:

- Completely built from the ground up (not based off the Unity graphics)
- The original 4:3 portion is left completely unaltered
- Ultrawide (21:9) aspect ratio support
- Custom animation for Doom 1 Episode 3
- Includes widescreen weapon sprite fixes (only Doom's Super Shotgun for now)

Future updates will cover the other IWAD games (Heretic, Hexen, Strife, Chex
Quest and Hacx). Stay tuned!
